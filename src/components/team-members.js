I’m an enthusiastic writer and am looking forward to working on the Halo magazine along with being the Head of Writing/Pitching. I strive to improve myself every day by exploring new concepts and reflecting on myself. When I’m not pitching new ideas, I love to read and cook.
I'm interested in pursuing a deeper knowledge of behavioral economics, computer science, and business.
Currently, I’m a content writer at an economics club, doing research on behavioral economics, working with the local government hospital, indulging in various competitions, and trying to keep up with my studies.
