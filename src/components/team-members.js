I am 16 and Founder at Auxin. I develop meaningful experiences on the Web, Mobile, and Cloud. I'm also an avid ML/AI Engineer working to solve problems and make the world a better place. 

When I'm not writing code, I enjoy writing stories on Medium, poems, articles, and research papers while also swimming to keep my body in sync. I am interested in fields such as Science and want to know more about them. I'm looking to pursue my undergrad in CS and Philosophy.

I'm interested in pursuing a deeper knowledge of behavioral economics, computer science, and business.
Currently, Iâ€™m a content writer at an economics club, doing research on behavioral economics, working with the local government hospital, indulging in various competitions, and trying to keep up with my studies.`,

        typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
        survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
        Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
        more recently with desktop publishing software like
        Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.`,
